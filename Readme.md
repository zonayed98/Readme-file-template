<!-- Markdown Practice -->
This is normal text in Markdown language  
We can use double space for new line instead of br tag. Use three hypen (-)) to make an horizontal rule.  

__Note:__ We can use html tags to make this language perfect. Even though this language has some individual syntax. Basically we gonna learn MD syntax in this practice.
